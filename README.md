# Pacman-AI-Search

### Overview
This project is part of the UC Berkeley CS188 Artificial Intelligence course. The goal is to build intelligent agents for the Pacman environment using various search algorithms and AI techniques. The Pacman AI agent is designed to navigate through complex mazes, avoid ghosts, and collect food efficiently. The project includes:
 - Implementing search algorithms like DFS, BFS, UCS, and A*.
 - Developing smart ghost behavior using probability models.
 - Designing effective heuristics to improve Pacmanâ€™s decision-making.
